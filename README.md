# Pyce Tools

A PYthon library for calculating, cleaning, and analyzing iCE nucleating particle (INP) data. :ice_cube:

Pyce Tools allows users to easily:

* Create experiment report files (xlsx format) by loading and processing raw experiment (or blank) csv data files of seawater or filter extract samples obtained from the LED-based Ice Nucleation Detection Apparatus (LINDA).
* Create cleaned, combined time series files from experiment report files for further processing and analysis in Python.
* Load and wrangle inverted differential mobility particle sizer (DMPS) data from LAMP's Scanotron instrument and condensation particle counter (CPC, TSI Inc.) time series data files into single time series files which are readily manipulated for further exploratory data analysis (EDA).
* Plot time series of particle surface area and number size distributions.
* Create plots of common INP graphs, including comparison with literature values.
* Normalize INP concentrations by particle surface area.
* Calculate and plot correlations between seawater parameters and INP concentrations.

## Installation

For now, Pyce Tools is installed simply by cloning this repository into your workspace.

## Requirements

* Pandas
* openpyxl
* Plotly
* *Recommended:* Jupyter Notebooks
* *Recommended:* ipykernal

If you're using conda package manager, simply type the following into the terminal to install dependencies:
```
conda install --file requirements.txt
```


## Getting Started

In your Jupyter Notebook (or equivalent workspace), alter your system path to include pyce_tools root folder:
```python
import sys
sys.path.append('PATH\\TO\\PYCE_TOOLS')
```

Then, import Pyce Tools by typing the following:
```python
import pyce_tools.pyce_tools as pt
```

See [the documentation](https://pyce-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) or the tutorial notebook located in the tutorial folder for a complete overview.

## Usage

See the complete [Getting Started guide](https://pyce-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) for a general overview and introduction to Pyce Tools.
