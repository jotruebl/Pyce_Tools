# Pyce Tools

A PYthon library for loading, cleaning, and analyzing iCE nucleating particle (INP) data. :ice_cube:

Pyce Tools allows users to easily:

* Create experiment report files (xlsx format) by loading and processing raw experiment (or blank) csv data files from the LED-based Ice Nucleation Detection Apparatus (LINDA).
* Load and wrangle inverted differential mobility particle sizer (DMPS) data from LAMP's Scanotron instrument and condensation particle counter (CPC, TSI Inc.) time series data files into single time series files which are readily manipulated for further exploratory data analysis (EDA).
* Load pre-processed DMPS data files for EDA.
* Plot time series of surface area and number size distributions
* Create plots of common INP graphs with Wilson error bars (Agresti).


## Installation

For now, Pyce Tools is installed simply by cloning this repository into your workspace.

## Requirements

* Pandas
* openpyxl
* datetime
* Plotly
* *Recommended:* Jupyter Notebooks

## Usage

In your Jupyter Notebook (or equivalent workspace), alter your system path to include pyce_tools root folder:
```
import sys
sys.path.append('PATH\\TO\\PYCE_TOOLS')
```

Then, import Pyce Tools by typing the following:
```
import pyce_tools.pyce_tools as pt
```


## TO DO

* :heavy_check_mark: Clean and prep LINDA experiment report files into a single time series dataset for exploratory analysis (error bars and data) --> clean_calculated_in;calculate_wilson_errors
* :heavy_check_mark: Include functions for plotting surface area and number size distribution timeseries (error bars included) --> plot_number_dist; plot_surface_dist
* Function for downsampling to average of user-selected time periods.
* Include function for plotting common INP plots
* Improve time zone handling
* :heavy_check_mark: Include function for creating error bars for ice nucleating particles --> calculate_wilson_errors
* Include function for calculating INP concentrations normalized by particle surface area (see nz2020 in_bio_analysis notebook)
* Include function for calculating correlation terms (see PEACETIME notebooks)
* :heavy_check_mark: Include function for calculating particle surface areas --> surface_area
* Update documentation
* Include function for loading wilson errors
* update clean_aqualog fucntion
